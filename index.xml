      <description>Orange plastic cap
An indestructible cigarette butt
Hidden in sidewalk cracks
Orange plastic cap
As high-flying dragon memories
Chased by and forgotten
Orange plastic cap
A forbidden berry, glowing bright
Plastic, rendered immaculate
Orange plastic cap
Sinful communion with no wafer
Blood shed, for whom?
Orange plastic cap
Blood red cup with deep dreams
Of bread broken for me

      <description>On Tuesday, I saw a man injecting heroin. I was at the L, waiting for a train home. I was looking for a way to cross over the tracks and didn&amp;rsquo;t notice him at first. He was sitting on a bench, hunched over his right arm, as his whole universe collapsed to a 2-inch syringe plunged into his forearm.
I walked right by him. I got on my train.
I was afraid.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about to do start Mission Year, and all my thoughts and reflections are turning to action. Push has come to shove.
The process so far has been simply preparation, which involves two things: packing up my small apartment in Natick and, more dramatically, raising $8,800. Unlike AmeriCorps, Mission Year asks us to raise a significant amount of our support. It takes about $16,000 to pay for a year&amp;rsquo;s food and rent in Kensington, and we&amp;rsquo;re each asked to raise about half of that.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be starting a newsletter to share my Mission Year Journey. You can sign up here!
For Mission Year updates, I&amp;rsquo;ve got my new address and my service site, which will probably be Esperanza, a nation-wide organization focused towards serving Hispanics and Latinos.</description>

      <description>About this time last year, as I was finishing college and thinking about entering the &amp;ldquo;real world,&amp;rdquo; I realized that I had nowhere to live. To make matters worse, my job was going to be in suburban Massachusetts, about forty-five minutes outside of Boston, and, therefore, about forty-five minutes from anyone I knew. A long commute was out of the question, which meant rooming with someone familiar was out of the question too.</description>

      <description>For newsletter sign up, click here. Hi! My name is Tom Hale. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m working as a software engineer at Cognex Corporation outside of Boston, helping build the next generation of industrial barcode readers (yes, that is an industry, and a remarkably profitable one).
I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to be an engineer ever since I was five, when I realized that &amp;ldquo;professional cowboy&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the cards. In all those years, I never really asked why.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m starting a blog! See my About page for more about me.
This started as a side project after I foolishly bought the tomhale.me domain name.
Sadly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that a blog isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly useful unless you have something useful to say. I can easily get the same relief by screaming any errant thoughts out my window, and almost anything could have been a better use of my money.</description>
