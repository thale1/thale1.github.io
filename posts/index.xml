      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about to do start Mission Year, and all my thoughts and reflections are turning to action. Push has come to shove.
The process so far has been simply preparation, which involves two things: packing up my small apartment in Natick and, more dramatically, raising $8,800. Unlike AmeriCorps, Mission Year asks us to raise a significant amount of our support. It takes about $16,000 to pay for a year&amp;rsquo;s food and rent in Kensington, and we&amp;rsquo;re each asked to raise about half of that.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be starting a newsletter to share my Mission Year Journey. You can sign up here!
For Mission Year updates, I&amp;rsquo;ve got my new address and my service site, which will probably be Esperanza, a nation-wide organization focused towards serving Hispanics and Latinos.</description>

      <description>About this time last year, as I was finishing college and thinking about entering the &amp;ldquo;real world,&amp;rdquo; I realized that I had nowhere to live. To make matters worse, my job was going to be in suburban Massachusetts, about forty-five minutes outside of Boston, and, therefore, about forty-five minutes from anyone I knew. A long commute was out of the question, which meant rooming with someone familiar was out of the question too.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m starting a blog! See my About page for more about me.
This started as a side project after I foolishly bought the tomhale.me domain name.
Sadly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that a blog isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly useful unless you have something useful to say. I can easily get the same relief by screaming any errant thoughts out my window, and almost anything could have been a better use of my money.</description>
