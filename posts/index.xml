      <description>About this time last year, as I was finishing college and thinking about entering the &amp;ldquo;real world,&amp;rdquo; I realized that I had nowhere to live. To make matters worse, my job was going to be in suburban Massachusetts, about forty-five minutes outside of Boston, and, therefore, about forty-five minutes from anyone I knew. A long commute was out of the question, which meant rooming with someone familiar was out of the question too.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m starting a blog! See my About page for more about me.
This started as a side project after I foolishly bought the tomhale.me domain name.
Sadly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that a blog isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly useful unless you have something useful to say. I can easily get the same relief by screaming any errant thoughts out my window, and almost anything could have been a better use of my money.</description>
